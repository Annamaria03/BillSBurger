NutShell Text:

I had been coding for about two years before my aprox. two or more gap years at software development.
Sooo now, since I have very strong reason to ... personal swamp..leave it at this stage, please.

Anyway, the point is, last month I sat down to find out what left from that expanding knowledge I was building up at that time,
and this is the first result of it.
A Bill's Burger "app" challenged by Tim Buchalka (one of my favourite).

Well:
-I went for Abstract Factory Pattern as you can see on the UML diagram.
-Useful to know, it's a frame idea of burger selling application.
-I was trying to apply my dusty knowledge from Clean Code by Robert C Martin... I know , i know... I see my app BUT!*...

Further future:
My idea is to implement buttons instead of typing (obviously)...
Pimp a funky front-end design and displaying texts, - very important marketing trick, good talk.. ! -.
Store the sold items in database; I guess I will go for Mongo-Bongo. If you don't funky my Mongo-Bong, then I can be also Mongo DB.
Even I might want to go for building a DB storage to work from..
The road is long, I keep on dusting off my knowledge**, advancing in it, while trying to spare time on this project
beside my main duty: aka working for balancing my bills and trying to die.. (funny, right?! I know.. indeed.. )

*Honestly, I like this app; since I haven't been coding for a long-long time and this application runs and makes me smile.
At the other hand, I'm not going to start revealing my great "Pains" regarding this app.
Things like what could have been better at this stage, but I need to move one with my studies.
The goal has been achieved, I flexed to myself.
(imagine: after-work 3-4h coding sessions, days 8-9)
**like maven, apache TomCat, databases, js, html, cs.. ALGORITHMS
